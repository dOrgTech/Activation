## Description
I'd like to create a Minimum Viable DAO with as little custom code as possible, utilizing already existing building blocks. This DAO must be extendable for any use-case you can imagine.

In order to do this, I've taken heavy inspiration from DAOstack's Arc contracts, and Gnosis's Safe contracts, and Jordi Baylina's MiniMe Token.

## Time-Frame
5 hours

## Details
### Core Contracts
[DAO.sol]() - TODO  
[VotingCredits.sol]() - TODO  
[VotingMachine.sol]() - TODO  

### Extensions
[capabilities/MultiCall.sol]() - TODO  

### Factories

## Closing Notes
TODO notes about where I didn't get a chance to take it
